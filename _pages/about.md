**Iâ€™m actively seeking full-time employment in Business and Economics field.**

I will graduate from Ohio Wesleyan University in May 2024 with Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Economics. My academic journey has been marked by academic excellence, scholarships, and involvement in the International Economic Honor Society. My internships have equipped me with invaluable skills in operations management, data analysis, and strategic problem-solving. Beyond the classroom, I have a track record of freelance projects and community service, reflecting my dedication to making a positive impact. Eager to leverage my skills and enthusiasm, I am excited to connect with professionals and explore career opportunities. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
